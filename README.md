### CS 24200

This repository showcases my work from Purdue's CS 24200 Intro to Data Science class. All of the questions are property of Purdue University, and any student who uses my work for any future assignments are doing so at their own risk. Academic dishonesty is a major problem, and professor and TA's have their ways of knowing if you cheat.
